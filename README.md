# 66days_ML
All about my learning journey of this Machine Learning!

🏆 **Day 1of #66DaysOfML!** 

💡 **MLflow:**
The Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and a UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides Model lineage, Model versioning, Stage transitions & Annotations. A client of an MLflow Tracking Server creates and manages experiments and runs.

🎯 I have been learning and experimenting MLOps from #MLOpsZoomcamp. I have learned about Experiment Tracking and Model Management, Model Registry, MLflow Client, MLOps Workflow Orchestration, and a few more topics related to the same from here.

📈 I have presented the implementation of Model Training here in the snapshot. I hope you will gain some insights and spend some time learning the topics from the course mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead.
